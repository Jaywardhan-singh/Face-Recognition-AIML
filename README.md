# AIML-Based Face Detection & Recognition

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing face detection within images or video frames using Python. Leveraging the power of various libraries and modules, the system aims to provide an efficient and accurate face detection solution. The project integrates a user-friendly interface with face detection algorithms and a database to offer real-time face detection capabilities.

## Objectives

- **Develop a Face Detection System**: Create a system that can accurately detect faces in images or video frames.
- **Utilize Various Libraries and Modules**: Employ libraries such as OpenCV, Tkinter, MySQL, PIL, and NumPy for different aspects of the project.
- **Enable Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time face detection by processing video frames using the Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **Demonstrate Practical Applicability**: Showcase the system's effectiveness in real-world scenarios like surveillance and biometrics.

## Technologies and Modules Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For face detection and image processing.
- **Tkinter**: To build a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **PIL**: For image handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **MySQL**: For database management and storing face data.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in static images and video frames.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Processes video frames in real-time to detect faces.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI for interacting with the system.
- **Database Integration**: Manages and stores face data for recognition and verification.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jaywardhan-singh/Face-Recognition-AIML.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd face-recognition-aiml
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Configure the MySQL database connection:
   - Open the `config.ini` file and provide the necessary details for your MySQL database connection (host, port, username, password, database name).
   - Save and close the file.
     
## Usage

To run the face recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your webcam is properly connected to your computer.

2. Execute the following command to start the application:
```
python main.py
```

3. The GUI window will appear, providing options for face enrollment, face recognition, and other functionalities. Follow the instructions on the screen to interact with the system.

4. Enjoy the face recognition system! You can enroll new faces, recognize existing ones, and explore the different features of the application.
